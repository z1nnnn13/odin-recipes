            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all mass gainer protein shake. But a few things to consider are the amount of your calorie intake and your body type.</p>
                <p>Some body types burn fat quickly and can easily form lean muscles.</p>
                <p>However, other body types have a difficult time with weight gain to build muscles, and they need a different approach.</p>
                <p>If you want weight gain for bulking, you must aim for 700-1000 calories per day.</p>
